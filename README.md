# WebDownloader
WebDownloader downloads web pages, and makes use of the /python-cs-361 microservice to translate the webpages.

The code in the directory /python-cs-361 is not mine. It is from here: https://github.com/Haru825/CS361-Project/blob/main/myTranslate.py

My code is located in /src/main/java/webdownloader/downloader.java.
